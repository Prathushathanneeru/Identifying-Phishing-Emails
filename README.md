# Identifying-Phishing-Emails
A phishing email is a fraudulent message that appears to come from a legitimate source, often used to steal sensitive data like usernames, passwords, or credit card numbers.

1.Examine Sender's Email Address for Spoofing

What it means: Attackers often fake (or spoof) the sender’s address to make the email look like it’s from a trusted source.

What to look for:

Slight misspellings (e.g., support@paypa1.com instead of support@paypal.com)

Generic domains (e.g., Gmail or Yahoo for corporate communication)

Inconsistencies between the display name and actual email

Always we have to check the actual address not the name

2.Check email headers for discrepancies (using online header analyzer).

Email headers contains the path. That is where the email came from is Known by using online header Analyzer

We can analyze our email headers through online header analyzer like MxToolbox Email Header Analyzer.

We have to look for anomalies such as:

IP addresses from strange countries

Received fields that don’t align with the claimed sender

SPF, DKIM, or DMARC failures (authentication problems)

3.Identify suspicious links or attachments.

We have to check the suspicious links which are of URL. Also look for unrelated Domains.

Avoid clicking links.

Check for any suspicious attachments in the Emails with (eg: .pdf, .exe, .docm, .zip)these may include malicious scripts.

So, Aware of these attachments from emails.

4.Look for urgent or threatening language in the email body.

Many Phishing emails contains the threatening message such as "your account has been hacked", "Immediate action required",etc.

These will create fear,pressure or time urgency.

5.Note any mismatched URLs (hover to see real link).

Hover your mouse over any hyperlink (without clicking).

If the displayed link differs from the actual destination, it's likely malicious.

For Example:Text shows: https://www.google.com

Hover reveals: http://malicious-site.ru/login

On mobile devices, you can long-press links (without tapping) to preview them.

6.Verify presence of spelling or grammar errors.

We have to check the grammar mistackes in emails.Those mistackes like:

Broken sentences

Misspellings or awkward phrasing

Inconsistent tone

Attackers intentionally writes grammar errors which will bypass the spam filters and they will target less attentive users.
